# A list of Honorary Guest Lecturers from the past few years:
 
- **2018, Ronald D. Fricker, Ph.D.**, Professor and Department Head, Department of Statistics, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.
 
- **2016, Karen Khafadar, Ph.D.**, Commonwealth Professor and Chair, Department of Statistics, University of Virginia. Title: "Detecting tiny signals in massive data from high-energy physics."" 
    - **Abstract:** Experiments in high-energy physics provide terabytes of data, from which critical information about the state of matter, governed by the theory outlined in the "Standard Model", must be extracted.  Opportunities abound for increased efficiencies in approaches to the data, from the design of experiments, to the collection of data, and finally to analysis and inference.  Due to the massive amounts of data, from various sources (different experiments from different collaborations, experiment-based simulations, etc.), new ways of analyzing the data to answer questions of interest are devised. This talk describes the framework for these experiments and illustrates methods for analyzing massive data sets from such experiments (with some mention of data sets from genomics and the Internet).
