The Virginia Chapter of the American Statistical Association will hold its annual meeting at the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, on Friday, October 25, 2019. We are pleased to announce that [Dr. Susan Ellenberg](https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p4930413), Professor of Biostatistics in the University of Pennsylvania Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, will deliver the Honorary Guest Lecture. American Statistical Association President [Dr. Karen Kafadar](https://statistics.as.virginia.edu/faculty-staff/profile/kk3ab), Commonwealth Professor and Chair of the University of Virginia Department of Statistics, will also deliver a Guest Lecture.

We are currently accepting abstracts for consideration of oral and poster presentations, see the [program](/program/) for details. Abstracts may focus on current and novel topics in statistics, biostatistics, genomics, bioinformatics or other related fields. ASA and Chapter members, industry professionals, academic faculty, and both undergraduate and graduate students within the Commonwealth of Virginia are especially encouraged to submit an abstract, though all are welcome to attend. Please submit your titles, abstracts and affiliations via the following Virginia Chapter website (which can be accessed [here](http://bit.ly/asava2019)) by September 27, 2019. Decisions on accepted presentations and posters will be made shortly thereafter. Please direct questions and inquiries to Roy T. Sabo, Ph.D. (<a href = "mailto:roy.sabo@vcuhealth.org?subject = Feedback&body = Message">roy.sabo@vcuhealth.org</a>), regarding abstract submissions and to Jeffrey Woo, Ph.D., (<a href = "mailto:yjw4b@virginia.edu?subject = Feedback&body = Message">yjw4b@virginia.edu</a>), regarding travel and accommodations.

All attendees and presenters can register on site ($10 registration fee for students; $20 registration fee for professionals and faculty) to help support the Chapter and so that we can provide light refreshments. Additional notices will be sent as we approach the meeting, including specific details on the agenda, registration, and parking.
