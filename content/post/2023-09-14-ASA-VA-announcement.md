The Virginia Chapter of the American Statistical Association will hold its annual meeting at Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, on Friday, October 27, 2023. We are pleased to announce that Dr. Sarah Ratcliffe, Professor and Chair of the Division of Biostatistics at the Department of Public Health Sciences, University of Virginia, will deliver the Honorary Guest Lecture.

We are currently accepting abstracts for consideration of oral and poster presentations, which will also be held during the plenary session. Abstracts may focus on current and novel topics in statistics, biostatistics, genomics, bioinformatics or other related fields. ASA and Chapter members, industry professionals, academic faculty, and both undergraduate and graduate students within the Commonwealth of Virginia are especially encouraged to submit an abstract, though all are welcome to attend. Please submit your titles, abstracts and affiliations or direct questions and inquiries via email mentioning “VA-ASA: 'subject of your email'” in the subject line, to Dr. Priyam Das, Ph.D., Local Coordinator of the VA-ASA; dasp4@vcu.edu, by October 9, 2023. Decisions on accepted presentations and posters will be made shortly thereafter.

All attendees and presenters must register on site ($10 registration fee for students; $20 registration fee for professionals and faculty; we accept cash, checks (made out to the Virginia Chapter of the American Statistical Association) and Venmo (@Roy-Sabo)) to help support the Chapter and so that we can provide light refreshments. Additional notices will be sent as we approach the meeting, including specific details on the agenda, registration, and parking.
