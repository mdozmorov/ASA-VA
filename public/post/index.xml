      <description>2018 recipients of the Award for Annual Meeting Outstanding Student Presentations Mohammed Alqawba Title: Copula Based Models for Zero-Inflated Count Time Series
Abstract: Count time series data are observed in several applied disciplines such as in environmental field, biostatistics, economics, public health, and finance. In some cases, a specific count, say zero, may occur more often than usual. Overlooking the frequent occurrence of zeros could lead to false inference. In this presentation, we develop a copula-based time series model for zero-inflated counts with the presence of covariates.</description>
